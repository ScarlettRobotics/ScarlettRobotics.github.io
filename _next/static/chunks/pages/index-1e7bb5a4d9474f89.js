It was an amazing experience and put us in perspective of what our club can achieve and become. This competition will reveal the world of engineering, industrial design, and project management to an enthusiastic group of students. Our team is organized into teams of project managers, electrical technicians, industrial designers, mechanical technicians and programmers.
